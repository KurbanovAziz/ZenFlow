# The following line prevents the package from being accidentally published to
# pub.dev using `flutter pub publish`. This is preferred for private packages.
publish_to: 'none' # Remove this line if you wish to publish to pub.dev

# The following defines the version and build number for your application.
# A version number is three numbers separated by dots, like 1.2.43
# followed by an optional build number separated by a +.
# Both the version and the builder number may be overridden in flutter
# build by specifying buildname and buildnumber, respectively.
# In Android, buildname is used as versionName while buildnumber used as versionCode.
# Read more about Android versioning at https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/versioning
# In iOS, buildname is used as CFBundleShortVersionString while buildnumber is used as CFBundleVersion.
# Read more about iOS versioning at
# https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/documentation/General/Reference/InfoPlistKeyReference/Articles/CoreFoundationKeys.html
# In Windows, buildname is used as the major, minor, and patch parts
# of the product and file versions while buildnumber is used as the build suffix.

# To automatically upgrade your package dependencies to the latest versions
# consider running `flutter pub upgrade majorversions`. Alternatively,
# dependencies can be manually updated by changing the version numbers below to
# the latest version available on pub.dev. To see which dependencies have newer
# versions available, run `flutter pub outdated`.

  # The "flutter_lints" package below contains a set of recommended lints to

  # package. See that file for information about deactivating specific lint
  # rules and activating additional ones.

  # The following line ensures that the Material Icons font is
  # included with your application, so that you can use the icons in
  # the material Icons class.
  uses-material-design: true

  # To add assets to your application, add an assets section, like this:
  assets:
    - assets/images/
  #    images/a_dot_ham.jpeg

  # An image asset can refer to one or more resolutionspecific "variants", see
  # https://flutter.dev/assetsandimages/#resolutionaware

  # For details regarding adding assets from package dependencies, see
  # https://flutter.dev/assetsandimages/#frompackages

  # To add custom fonts to your application, add a fonts section here,
  # in this "flutter" section. Each entry in this list should have a
  # "family" key with the font family name, and a "fonts" key with a
  # list giving the asset and other descriptors for the font. For
  # example:
  # fonts:
  #    family: Schyler
  #     fonts:
  #        asset: fonts/SchylerRegular.ttf
  #        asset: fonts/SchylerItalic.ttf
  #         style: italic
  #    family: Trajan Pro
  #     fonts:
  #        asset: fonts/TrajanPro.ttf
  #        asset: fonts/TrajanPro_Bold.ttf
  #         weight: 700
  #
  # For details regarding fonts from package dependencies,
